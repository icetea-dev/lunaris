# **Hi there**

## Here you can find a free selfbot.

You just have to follow the instructions for setting up the selfbot:

- Make sure you have Python 3.11 or higher installed on your desktop.
- Download `updater.py`.
- Make sure you have the dependencies installed. To do this, run `pip install aiohttp asyncio`. Other dependencies used by the selfbot are installed by the updater in a virtual environment.
- Start `updater.py` with `py updater.py`.
- You can find the installed files in `%appdata%\Lunaris Selfbot\`.
- Put your token in the `settings.json` file, which you can find in `%appdata%\Lunaris Selfbot\settings\settings.json` before starting Lunaris.
- Select `y` in the updater to start Lunaris.

Enjoy!
